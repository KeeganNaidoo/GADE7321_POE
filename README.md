# GADE7321_POE_2024
Repo for GADE7321 part 2 &amp; 3 groupwork 2024

## Group Members:
- Skyler Considine
- Keegan Naidoo

## Part 2:
- Design your game.
- Design the game state representation and utility function.
- Finally implement a working “human vs. human” prototype of your game.

## Your Git submission will consist of the following:
1. One document that includes:
- A High Concept Statement. [5]
- A full set of game rules. Someone should be able to play your game based on just
reading these rules. [15]
- The game state representation. A full description, with examples, of how you intend
to represent and store the game state within your code. essentially means the layout of the board and any game information after each
move.) [20]
- The game state utility function. A full description of the mathematical equation used
to calculate the result as well as examples of how you intend to evaluate the utility or
value of a given game state. [20]

2. A playable prototype with the following:
- Multiplayer “hot seat” play (i.e., two players taking turns on the same device). [10]
- A fixed default map. [10]
- Full implementation of the game rules in the code. [20]
